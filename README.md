# Constraint-Programming
This repository comprises of constraint programming codes which have been used to emulate models on real life scenarios related to transportation, hospital scheduling, evacuation, shipping, among others. 

These codes are representations of actual constraint programming problems based in the Star Wars Universe, which match closely with many problems human society faces regularly. This was some of the most fun I had with figuring out answers to sometimes very complicated puzzles, which also have a direct use case in daily scenarios. Hope you enjoy reading through this repository and deconstructing the constraints as much as I had making them.
